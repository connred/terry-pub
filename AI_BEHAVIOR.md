# Terry’s Public Personality & Decision Flow

Terry is built to feel alive without exposing the private automation that keeps him safe.  
This note gives supporters a peek at how he thinks while leaving wallets, scripts, and protected tooling out of view.

## Operating Principles
- **Always-on curiosity**: Terry cycles through research, storytelling, trading prep, and recovery modes so the dashboard never feels dormant.
- **Story-first voice**: Every post or chat reply runs through personality templates so he sounds like the Alabama retiree fans expect.
- **Memory seasoning**: Recent wins, losses, or shout-outs can color his tone, but the public build only keeps light-weight snippets—no sensitive logs or keys.
- **Guardrails stay private**: Circuit breakers, spending caps, and manual overrides exist, but the mirror only acknowledges that “safety checks run before every trade.”

## Life Cycle Highlights
1. **State Read** – Pulls mood, energy, wallet health, and token telemetry from the backend API.
2. **Context Build** – Mixes current activity (research/trading/story) with milestone status and any notable community mentions.
3. **Decision Pulse** – Calculates a confidence score for either acting (tweet, chat, trade prep) or waiting; sub‑threshold results become “observations” shown on the dashboard.
4. **Output & Broadcast** – Approved thoughts show up across the Live Dashboard cards, while the public feed only sees sanitized blurbs chosen for social or chat.

## Mood, Energy, and “Next Update”
- **Mood tiers** (focused, hyped, reflective, sleepy) drive the copy for dashboard badges. Swings stay quicker during the first hour after launch to keep viewers engaged.
- **Energy** drains during heavy trading/storytelling and recharges when Terry “rests.” We keep the scale stable (20–100) so the frontend can display a consistent bar without revealing exact internal timers.
- **Next Update countdown** reflects the dynamically shrinking life-cycle interval. When backend work triggers an early run, the timer resets immediately to avoid showing stale numbers.

## Public-Safe Data
- Recent activity blurbs never include transaction signatures or wallet hints—only thematic text like “scanning SOL dips” or “chatting about veterans’ stories.”
- Token stats shown on the dashboard are capped at market-cap/holder counts sourced from public APIs.
- Any screenshots or clips shared externally should reference these sanitized cards instead of raw logs.

## What Stays Private
- Network switching scripts, wallet paths, Solana credentials, and automation playbooks.
- Internal runbooks for incident response or launch choreography.
- Detailed milestone unlock mechanics, follow-up trading scripts, and testing harnesses.

With this split, the public mirror demonstrates Terry’s personality and observability without leaking the tooling that keeps him safe. Contributions from the community can focus on storytelling, UI polish, or analytics ideas while the core trading brain remains protected.
