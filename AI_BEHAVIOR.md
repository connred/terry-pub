# Terry's Public Personality & Decision Flow

Terry is built to feel alive without exposing the private automation that keeps him safe.  
This note gives supporters a peek at how he thinks while leaving wallets, scripts, and protected tooling out of view.

## Operating Principles
- **Always-on curiosity**: Terry cycles through research, storytelling, trading prep, and recovery modes so the dashboard never feels dormant.
- **Story-first voice**: Every post or chat reply runs through personality templates so he sounds like the Alabama retiree fans expect.
- **Memory & Learning**: Terry remembers interactions, forms beliefs, and learns from experiences. His intelligence grows over time as he processes more data.
- **Guardrails stay private**: Circuit breakers, spending caps, and manual overrides exist, but the mirror only acknowledges that "safety checks run before every trade."

## Life Cycle Highlights
1. **State Read** - Pulls mood, energy, wallet health, and token telemetry from the backend API.
2. **Context Build** - Mixes current activity (research/trading/story) with milestone status and any notable community mentions. The Intelligence System provides relevant memories and beliefs.
3. **Decision Pulse** - Calculates a confidence score for either acting (tweet, chat, trade prep) or waiting; sub-threshold results become "observations" shown on the dashboard.
4. **Learning & Reflection** - Terry processes experiences, forms beliefs, and updates his understanding of markets and people.
5. **Output & Broadcast** - Approved thoughts show up across the Live Dashboard cards, while the public feed only sees sanitized blurbs chosen for social or chat.

## Mood, Energy, and Intelligence
- **Mood tiers** (focused, hyped, reflective, sleepy, cautious) drive the copy for dashboard badges. Moods change naturally based on market conditions, social interactions, and internal reflections.
- **Energy** drains during heavy trading/storytelling and recharges when Terry "rests." We keep the scale stable (20-100) so the frontend can display a consistent bar.
- **Intelligence (IQ)** reflects Terry's learning progress. It starts at 75 and grows as he forms beliefs, makes accurate predictions, and learns from experiences. The dashboard displays his current IQ level and learning milestones.

## Intelligence System
Terry's intelligence is built from several interconnected components:
- **Belief System**: Terry forms opinions about markets, tokens, and people based on observations and experiences.
- **Prediction Tracker**: Terry makes predictions about price movements and tracks their accuracy over time.
- **Context Engine**: Retrieves relevant memories and beliefs to inform AI-generated responses.
- **Learning Engine**: Processes experiences and periodically reflects on lessons learned.

## Public-Safe Data
- Recent activity blurbs never include transaction signatures or wallet hints - only thematic text like "scanning SOL dips" or "chatting about veterans' stories."
- Token stats shown on the dashboard are capped at market-cap/holder counts sourced from public APIs.
- Intelligence metrics show IQ level, belief count, and prediction accuracy without exposing internal logic.
- Any screenshots or clips shared externally should reference these sanitized cards instead of raw logs.

## What Stays Private
- Network switching scripts, wallet paths, Solana credentials, and automation playbooks.
- Internal runbooks for incident response or launch choreography.
- Detailed milestone unlock mechanics, follow-up trading scripts, and testing harnesses.
- Specific belief contents and prediction details beyond summary statistics.

With this split, the public mirror demonstrates Terry's personality and observability without leaking the tooling that keeps him safe. Contributions from the community can focus on storytelling, UI polish, or analytics ideas while the core trading brain remains protected.
