# Overview

Terry is a character driven project that explores how software can hold a consistent voice and narrative while interacting with people and data. The repository focuses on design and safety. It is not a turnkey product.

## Scope

- Character system with mood, memory, and behavior
- Safety first trading framework with limits and circuit breakers
- Premium response path using x402 for paid replies
- High level interfaces to Twitter, Solana, and language models

## Out of scope

- Production deployment instructions
- Token launch steps and operations
- Monetization templates

## Architecture at a glance

- PersonalityEngine defines tone and state
- ConsciousnessEngine manages attention and thought cadence
- BehaviorEngine drives daily cycles
- DecisionEngine handles multi factor choices
- MemorySystem stores experience and context
- TradingEngine executes guarded actions
- TokenManager tracks the project token

Integrations are isolated behind service layers. Safety checks sit in front of any operation that can change state on chain or on a social surface.

## Safety

- Limits on frequency and size of actions
- Circuit breakers for loss and abnormal market behavior
- Manual controls for pauses and overrides

## Premium responses

Premium requests route through a 402 pattern. When verified, the response engine switches to a deeper prompt and larger token budget. The payment and verification details are abstracted.
