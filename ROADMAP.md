# Roadmap

This roadmap communicates intent, not promises. Items may change.

## Near term
- Expand observability with simple metrics and logs
- Clarify public docs and examples
- Add richer dashboard timelines for Terry's mood/behavior

## Medium term
- Improve memory scoring and retrieval
- Add more safety scenarios and tests
- Deepen relationship tracking and sentiment awareness

## Longer term
- Research richer behavior cycles and user relationships
- Evaluate de-risked paths for limited production pilots
- Investigate external integrations that keep Terry strictly non-custodial
